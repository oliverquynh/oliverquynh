## Introduction

Hi there,

- 🎤 I'm Oliver Quynh, from Vietnam.
- 💻 I work as a full stack web developer.
- 💖 I really enjoy working with the LEMP+Node stack on Ubuntu.
- 📚 My next journey is to explore Go, AI, Cloud and DevOps.
- 😅 Fun fact, I used to code in Notepad++ and Sublime Text, then moved to VS Code. I spent some time with JetBrains IDEs, but now I've circled back to VS Code.
- ❤️ In the near future, I also aspire to become a health mentor.
- 💬 Ask me anything about software development or health mentoring.
- 📫 How to reach me?
